The dataset selected is The Ames Housing dataset obtained from Kaggle and compiled by Dean De Cock. The dataset is a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

### Barchart
1. A drop-down menu allows users to select the variable shown.  
2. Pick a variable and bin it into a fixed range to create a bar chart of the variable you picked.  
3. On mouse-over, the color of the bar is changed to highlight it.  

### Bivariate Scatterplot 
* user picks any two variables from a menu
 
### 10×10 Correlation Matrix 
* map positive/negative correlations to red/blue with intensity indicating correlation strength

### 5×5 Scatterplot Matrix 
* attributes with greatest aggregated correlation strength

### Parallel Coordinates
* pairs by correlation strength

### PCA plot 
* Top 2 eigenvectors with associated scree plot
* Biplot With 10 projected axes (project all into top 2 PCA vectors)

### MDS
* MDS display of the data (Euclidian distance)
* MDS display of the attributes (1-|correlation| distance)

### Dashboard
* Barchart, scatterplot, biplot, and MDS with agglomerative or K-Means clusters
